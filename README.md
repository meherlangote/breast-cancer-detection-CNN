Breast Cancer Detection Using Ultrasound Images and CNN
Overview
This project aims to detect breast cancer from ultrasound images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on a dataset of ultrasound images labeled with benign and malignant conditions to predict whether a given image shows signs of breast cancer.

Dataset
The dataset consists of ultrasound images of breast tissue, divided into benign and malignant classes. Each image is accompanied by a corresponding label indicating its classification.

Preprocessing
Normalization: Pixel values of the images were scaled to the range [0, 1] to facilitate model convergence.
Augmentation: Training images were augmented using rotations, flips, and zooms to increase dataset diversity and improve generalization.
CNN Architecture
The CNN architecture used for this project is based on [describe your chosen architecture, e.g., a custom CNN or a pre-trained model like VGG16].

Training and Validation
The dataset was split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets.
Training involved minimizing cross-entropy loss using stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate of [specify learning rate].
Model performance was monitored on the validation set to prevent overfitting.
Testing and Evaluation
The trained model was evaluated on a separate test dataset not seen during training.
Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were calculated to assess the model's effectiveness.
